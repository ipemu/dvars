# Elastic displacement, velocity and acceleration response spectra

Pseudo Acceleration Response Spectra (PARS), or Pseudo-spectral Acceleration (PSA) is a method used to determine the response spectrum of a structure to an earthquake.

This code is based on the use of the classic ``rdcalcdp`` algorithm taken from
the https://github.com/GFZ-Centre-for-Early-Warning/exsim/EXSIM12.for

This project provides a simple wrapper for calling a subroutine ``rdcalcdp`` implemented here in C from Python.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- ctypes
